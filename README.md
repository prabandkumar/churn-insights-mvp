# Churn Insights Dashboard

Understand why customers leave. Fix the right problem first.

---

## Overview

Churn Insights Dashboard is a lightweight analytics tool that helps teams quickly understand **when customers churn, how much revenue is lost, and whether the real issue is onboarding or long-term retention**.

Instead of complex dashboards and overwhelming metrics, this tool focuses on **clear, actionable insight** — helping teams decide what to fix first.

---

## Problem

Most companies track churn, but struggle to **understand the real cause**.

Teams often:

- Measure churn without diagnosing it  
- Focus on late-stage churn instead of early drop-off  
- Lose revenue without clear direction on what to fix  

Without clarity, retention efforts become guesswork.

---

## Solution

Churn Insights Dashboard analyzes simple customer lifecycle data to:

1. Measure **early churn (first 30 days)**  
2. Calculate **monthly revenue lost from churn**  
3. Identify whether the problem is:
   - Onboarding failure (users leave too early)
   - Retention decay (users leave later)

**Goal:** Provide immediate clarity — not just data.

## Prototype Features

- Upload any churn CSV (simple format)  
- Early churn detection  
- Revenue loss calculation  
- Root cause signal (Onboarding vs Retention)  
- Instant actionable recommendation  

No complex setup. No heavy analytics stack.

## Why This Matters

A large percentage of churn often happens **before customers experience real value**.

Fixing early churn can:

- Increase retention  
- Improve customer lifetime value (LTV)  
- Reduce revenue leakage  
- Improve product growth without more acquisition  

Clarity leads to better retention decisions.

## Current Status

This is a focused prototype designed to validate:

- Churn insight usefulness  
- Simple revenue-loss visibility  
- Clear decision guidance (what to fix first)  

Next step: deeper retention analytics, segmentation, and predictive churn intelligence.

## Target Users

Initially:

- SaaS founders  
- Product teams  
- Growth & retention teams  
- Data-driven startups  

Long term:

Any business where **customer retention impacts revenue**.

---

## Vision

Retention should not require complex analytics to understand.

Simple signals — when interpreted correctly — can guide high-impact decisions.  
Future versions will move toward **predictive churn detection and automated retention guidance**.

The goal: turn churn data into clear action.
